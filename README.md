## Description

The Typing Speed Test App is a JavaScript application that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy.

## Usage Instructions

Users can assess their typing speed and accuracy within a 60-second timeframe. The test results are presented both visually on the screen and stored in a tabular format. As the test concludes, a designated metric section will turn green, indicating completion. At this point, users can review their performance results and improvement.

## Code Features

The codebase comprises the following components:

- **Comments and Explanations**: The code is well-commented, making it easy to navigate and modify. Additionally, explanations are provided to aid in understanding the code's logic.

- **Styling**: The codebase includes styling to enhance the visual appeal of the app.

- **HTML File**: The HTML file is structured to create the foundation of the app's interface.

- **JavaScript Functions**: The JavaScript code is organized across four separate files, each serving a specific purpose:

  1. `script.js`: handles user interactions, such as starting and resetting the typing test, displaying progress, and responding to key presses.
  2. `typing.js`: responsible for fetching data, displaying text on the screen for typing practice, and managing the typing test in a typing speed test app.
  3. `progress.js`: managing the display of progress, calculating and displaying improvements, and handling test completion events in the Typing Speed Test App.
  4. `metrics.js`: contains functions related to managing the timer, calculating accuracy and words per minute (WPM), and handling the test completion process in the Typing Speed Test App.
