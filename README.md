- **JavaScript Functions**: The JavaScript code is organized across four separate files, each serving a specific purpose:

  1. `script.js`: handles user interactions, such as starting and resetting the typing test, displaying progress, and responding to key presses.
  2. `typing.js`: responsible for fetching data, displaying text on the screen for typing practice, and managing the typing test in a typing speed test app.
  3. `progress.js`: managing the display of progress, calculating and displaying improvements, and handling test completion events in the Typing Speed Test App.
  4. `metrics.js`: contains functions related to managing the timer, calculating accuracy and words per minute (WPM), and handling the test completion process in the Typing Speed Test App.
